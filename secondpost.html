          <td>The product is useful because it provides structured lessons on meditating rather than just a timer. The product also provides instructions on how to apply lessons after the meditation session is done and to make you more aware. It is also useful because the app is the only equipment you need to perform the task. There are specific sessions focused on anxiety or for SOS situations. </td>

          <td>Headspace gives you 10 free sessions to try it out before purchasing. This offer gives the consumer the opportunity to get a feel for it before committing and paying. However, they do use persuasive design to make users consistent in using the app.</td>
          <td>The content encourages you to think about your motivations for doing meditation and encourages you to think how it will positively impact those around you.Also there's a lack of visual pollution.</td>

          <td colspan="2">The product is quite self explanatory when it comes to choosing sessions, ending a session, pausing a session.</td>
          <td>Headspace makes the goal clear from the start with the logo -an orange colored circle. The goal is not to visually stimulate you with the graphics but to simplify the visuals to process. This simple design is clear when you start a session and there’s one white circle on an orange background with a play/pause button in the middle, info about the number and time of lesson above, and an “x” providing the option to exit in the corner. The circle is not ornamental during the session, it is marking time. </td>
          <td>The sessions are set up in levels so it involves the psychological motivation of closure. There are badges that are checked upon completion and the badges you need to complete are left unchecked and in clear view. Also, there’s the partial reinforcement that if you complete 27 sessions in a row you can give a friend one month of headspace free. This is a delayed reward to motivate consistent long lasting behavior. However, after sessions are all completed, I may not continue spending money on Headspace. </td>

          <td>Only one part of the app is free. The downloaded Take a Break app includes links to the purchaseable apps that are specifically focused on certain issues. This makes it seem like this is a promotional app rather than a valid app. The validity of the app is also brought into question due to its aesthetics.</td>
           <td>There is no motivation provided like Headspace where sessions are accounted for or different levels provided to accomplish.</td>

You have to swipe right, which was not written anywhere for any amount of time. The text is blue on top of an image of blue water which makes text harder to read. Also, you must find out that the first volume controller is for the speaker and the second for the background noise by assumption or trial and error.</td>
          <td>They seemed to assume an image background behind light text was adding value but really it complicates and decreases validity of the app.</td>

          <td>The product comes with a warranty which is reassuring. There’s a feeling that the customer is thought of by providing multiple parts. The product comes with enough blades to give options on cutting different types of food. Also, there are different colored cup rings to distinguish between cups and for easier drinking. The feeling that the customer’s care is prioritized gives the feeling that the customer is not being manipulated.</td>
           <td>It is useful to blend small quantities quickly. It is useful that you do not have to transfer the blended ingredients into another cup to drink. It is also easy to clean because there are no nooks and crannies for food to seep into.</td>

          <td colspan="2">The assembly is intuitive and the blender won’t start working until assembled correctly, which also makes the product safe. What is not intuitive, at least to me, is which blade is supposed to be used for which types of foods. </td>
          <td>The product’s design eliminated the need for certain standard parts. For example, there are standard parts like the cover, the bottom bowl, motor, and separate blade. The Magic Bullet has a bottom blade which fits into the motor and acts as a cover for the blender bowl and the bowl also works as a cup.</td>
