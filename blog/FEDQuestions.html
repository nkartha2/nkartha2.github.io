			<li>
				<h4>What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?</h4>
				<p>
					Eloquent JS:Chapter 4 exercise 3 was a real challenge for me. The exercise was to write a function that allows you to have a list and a number as arguments and return the returns the element according to the given position (number argument) in the list. I had to come up with a recursive function that would go deeper into the list to find the correct value.

				<h4>What UI, Security, Performance, SEO, Maintainability or Technology considerations do you make while building a web application or site?</h4>
