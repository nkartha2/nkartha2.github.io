The product also provides instructions on how to apply lessons after the meditation session is done and to make you more aware. It is also useful because the app is the only equipment you need to perform the task. There are specific sessions focused on anxiety or for SOS situations. </td>

          <td>Headspace makes the goal clear from the start with the logo -an orange colored circle. The goal is not to visually stimulate you with the graphics but to simplify the visuals to process. This simple design is clear when you start a session and there’s one white circle on an orange background with a play/pause button in the middle, info about the number and time of lesson above, and an “x” providing the option to exit in the corner. The circle is not ornamental during the session, it is marking time. </td>
          <td>The sessions are set up in levels so it involves the psychological motivation of closure. There are badges that are checked upon completion and the badges you need to complete are left unchecked and in clear view. Also, there’s the partial reinforcement that if you complete 27 sessions in a row you can give a friend one month of headspace free. This is a delayed reward to motivate consistent long lasting behavior. However, after sessions are all completed, I may not continue spending money on Headspace. </td>

The product comes with enough blades to give options on cutting different types of food. Also, there are different colored cup rings to distinguish between cups and for easier drinking. The feeling that the customer’s care is prioritized gives the feeling that the customer is not being manipulated.</td>

The Magic Bullet has a bottom blade which fits into the motor and acts as a cover for the blender bowl and the bowl also works as a cup.</td>

           <td>It is useful to see what theaters are around and the rotten tomatoes review all in one place. However, Moviefone’s home screen involves an option to search theaters near you and then continues to list all the movies that are currently playing. Flixster has split up functionality where movies playing are on one page and theater selection is on another page. I think Moviefone having this dual functionality on one page makes it more useful. Also, when you click a movie off of the box office page, the next proceeding page is information about the movie but it does not contain information about what theaters are playing this movie. The user has to select the showtimes option which goes to a page that seems to only have the option to select a location because an advertisement blocks the location options so it is not clear you have to scroll down. </td>

It is not well executed. As shown in this image, the creators of this app placed the option to edit the user’s location near the advertisements. It is easy to accidentally click the advertisement, the advertisement breaks the content, and the advertisement and “theaters” header is more noticeable than the option to change locations. Also, to favorite a theater, the user has to select a theater which leads to another screen to favorite it. It seems like there could have been stars placed on the left of the screen so people could favorite a theater.</td>
